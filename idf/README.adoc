== Status of this document

This document provides information to the proteomics community about a proposed standard for sample metadata annotations in public repositories called Sample and Data Relationship File (SDRF)-Proteomics format. Distribution is unlimited.

Version Draft - this is a draft of version 1.0

== Abstract

The MAGE-TAB is composed by two main files SDRF and IDF. The IDF (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/help/creating_an_idf.html[investigation description format]) aims to capture the general description of the experiment and dataset. Similar to the exiting [ProteomeXchange.xml](http://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/resources/schema/proteomexchange/proteomeXchange-1.4.0.xsd) the IDF capture information about title of the experiment, a general description, or the submitter information.

The IDF describes the project and experiment general characteristics. :

-	The IDF should be compatible with the existing [ProteomeXchange.xml](http://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/resources/schema/proteomexchange/proteomeXchange-1.4.0.xsd).
-	The IDF is a Tab-delimited and key-value pair.

=== IDF Tags

The IDF component of a MAGE-TAB document consists of a set of unique tags attached to their corresponding values in a simple tab-delimited text format. For example, "Experiment Description" should be followed by a free-text description of the experiment. Most of the following fields can be used with more than one value, so that (for example - multiple experimental factors etc) multiple values can be defined in a single IDF file. In such cases the multiple values should be separated by semicolons (";")

NOTE: *Submitter and Lab Head names are witten in ProteomeXchange as a unique Name. The automatic conversion will try to split into Person First Name and Last Name for IDF.
