Investigation Title	NCI60 proteome by PCT-SWATH -  Quantitative Proteome Landscape of the NCI-60 Cancer Cell Lines
Experiment Description	We obtained quantitative analysis of the NCI-60 cell panels using pressure cycling technology (PCT) and SWATH-MS. Each cell was analyzed in duplicate. The data were analyzed using a cell line SWATH assay library and OpenSWATH, followed by SWATH-expert refinement.

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-Sample-PXD003539	P-MTAB-Data-PXD003539
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	The cell pellets was a generous gift from National Cancer Instutite, USA. Each cell line was lyzed and digested using pressure cycling technology (PCT) (Pubmed ID: 25730263). Each digest was analyzed in a tripleTOF 5600 under SWATH mode. The conventional 32 window scheme was used (Pubmed ID: 22261725).	The SWATH data were first analyzed using OpenSWATH with a SWATH assay library built from cell lines, containing 86,209 proteotypic peptide precursors in 8,056 proteotypic SwissProt proteins. Then the results were refined using SWATH-expert (manuscript in preparation)
