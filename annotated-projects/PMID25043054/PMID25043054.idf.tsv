Investigation Title	Proteogenomic characterization of human colon and rectal cancer
Experiment Description	Proteomes of colon and rectal tumors previously characterized by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed along with integrated proteogenomic analyses. Ninety-five TCGA tumor samples were used in this study from 90 patients, with 5 samples representing different portions from the same tumor. The samples originated from two TCGA cohorts: 64 are from Colon Adenocarcinoma (COAD) samples and 31 are from the Rectum Adenocarcinoma (READ) collection. The primary data from the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) global proteomic profiling of each tumor sample is associated with a data set in the table below. Three protein assemblies are provided from different protein database searches.

Protocol Description	All samples for the current study were obtained through the TCGA Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR) as described previously. Of the 276 samples described in the TCGA study, 95 specimens from 90 patients were available for the current study . No other selection criteria other than availability were applied for this study. Specimens for proteomic study were sectioned sequentially from the tumour blocks used for genomic studies, hence the â€˜bottomâ€?slides from the genomic studies are representative of the material used for proteomics. The slides are available from the TCGA data portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). All samples contained at least 60% tumour nuclei, as described earlier. Samples were shipped from the TCGA BCR in dry ice and kept frozen at 280 uC until processing. All TCGA colorectal tissue samples were washed before digestion to eliminate any residual optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT). The tissue was placed in a 1.5-ml micro-tube and washed with 1 ml 70% ethanol in water for 30 s with vortexing. The supernatant was then discarded and the tissue washed with 1 ml of 100% H2O for 30 s with vortexing and again the supernatant was discarded. One millilitre of 70% ethanol in water was added to the tissue sample and incubated for 5 min at 23 uCfollowing by centrifugation at 20,000g for 2 min at 20 uC. The supernatant was removed and this wash step was repeated. Next, 1 ml of 85% ethanol in water was added to the tissue and incubated for 5 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation at 20,000g for 2 min at 20 uC. The supernatant was removed the wash was repeated. For the final wash, the tissue was washed in 1 ml 100% ethanol and incubated for 5 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 20,000g for 2 min at 20 uC. The supernatant was removed and the wash was repeated. Patient-derived xenograft tumours from established basal(WHIM2) and luminal B(WHIM16) breast cancer intrinsic subtypes were raised subcutaneously in 8-week-oldNOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbour, Maine) as described previously. These tumours have significantly different gene expression and proteomic signatures that are related to their intrinsic biology and endocrine signalling. Tumours from each animal were collected by surgical excision at approximately 1.5 cm3 with minimal ischaemia time byimmediate immersion in a liquid nitrogen bath.The tumour tissues were then placed in pre-cooled tubes on dry ice and stored at 280 uC. A tissue â€˜poolâ€?of cryopulverized tumours was prepared in order to generate sufficient material that could be reliably shared and analysed between multiple laboratories. In brief, tumour pieces were transferred into pre-cooled Covaris Tissue-Tube 1 Extra (TT01xt) bags (Covaris no. 520007) and processed in a Covaris CP02 Cryoprep device using different impact settings according to the total tumour tissue weight,<250 mg = 53; 250â€?50 mg = 54; 350â€?40 mg = 55; 440â€?50 mg = 56. Tissue powder was transferred to an aluminium weighing dish (VWR no. 1131-436) on dry ice and the tissue was thoroughly mixed with a metal spatula precooled in liquid nitrogen. The tissue powder was then partitioned (,100-mg aliquots) into precooled cryovials (Corning no. 430487). All procedures were carried out on dry ice to maintain tissue in a powdered, frozen state. Protein extraction and peptide fractionation. Protein extraction and digestion of tissue specimens. Following OCT removal, tissue specimens were placed in 1.5-ml micro-centrifuge tubes and re-suspended in 100 ml of trifluoroethanol (TFE) and 100 ml of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. If additional buffer was required, equal volumes of TFE and 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0, were added accordingly. In addition, powderized xenograft tumour tissue representing the comparison and reference (CompRef) samples for luminal(WHIM16) and basal(WHIM2) breast cancer subtypeswere analysed with each set of 10TCGA colorectal tissue samples. Samples were sonicated using a Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator Model 100 at a setting of 20W for 20 s followed by 30 s incubation on ice. This sonication step was repeated twice and samples were placed on ice between sonications. The resulting homogenate was heated with shaking at 1000 r.p.m. for 1 h at 60 uC followed by a second series of sonication steps, as described above. A protein measurement then was obtained for each sample using the BCA Protein Assay (ThermoFisher Pierce, Rockford, Illinois) using the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. An aliquot equivalent to 200 mg was removed and reduced with tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP, 20 mM) and dithiothreitol (DTT, 50 mM) at 60 uC for 30 min followed by alkylation with iodoacetamide (IAM, 100 mM) in the dark at room temperature for 20 min. The lysate was diluted with the appropriate volume of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, to reduce the TFE concentration to 10%, trypsin was added at a ratio of 1:50 (w:w) and digested overnight at 37 uC. The digested mixture was frozen at280 uC and lyophilized to dryness. The lyophilized samples were re-suspended in 350 ml of high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade water and vortexed vigorously for 1 min and desalted using an Oasis HLB 96-well mElution plate (30 mm, 5 mg, Waters Corp., Milford, Massachusetts), which was pre-washed with 500 ml of acetonitrile and equilibrated with 750 ml of HPLC-grade water. The flow-through was discarded and the plates were washed with 500 ml of HPLC-grade water and the peptides eluted with 80% acetonitrile and the eluates were evaporated to dryness in vacuo. Samples were stored in the freezer until further analysis. Peptide fractionation by basic reverse-phase liquid chromatography. Samples were reconstituted in 300 ml of solventA (1.0Mtriethylamine bicarbonate (TEAB), pH 7.5). The reconstituted sample was then diluted with an additional 100 ml of solvent A and the entire 400 ml of solution was injected into the basic reversephase liquid chromatography (basic RPLC) column. Tryptic peptides were fractionated using high-pH RPLC separation with an XBridge BEH C18, 250 mm 3 4.6 mm analytical column (130A, 5 mm particle size) equipped with a XBridge BEH C18 Sentry guard cartridge at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min21. The solvents were 10mMTEAB, pH 7.5, in water as mobile phaseAand 100% acetonitrile as mobile phase B. Sample fractionation was accomplished using the following multistep linear gradient: from 0 to 5% B in 10 min, from 5 to 35% B in 60 min, from 35â€?70% in 15 min and held at 70% B for an additional 10 min before returning to initial conditions. A total of 60 fractions were collected over the 105-min gradient and concatenated into 15 fractions by combining fractions 1, 16, 31, 46; 2, 17, 32, 47; and so on up to fractions 15, 30, 45 and 60. The samples were evaporated to dryness in a Speed-Vac sample concentrator and stored at 280 uC until LC-MS/MS analysis.Resulting peptide fractions were resuspended in 50 ml of water containing 2%acetonitrile and 0.1%formic acid and analysed using a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap Velos ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an Eksigent NanoLC 2D pump and AS-1 autosampler. A 2-ml injection volume of the peptidesolution was separated on a packed capillary tip (Polymicro Technologies, 100 mm 311 cm) containing Jupiter C18 resin (5 mm, 300AËš , Phenomenex) using an in-line solid-phase extraction column (100 mm 3 6 cm) packed with the same C18 resin using a frit generated with liquid silicate Kasil41. Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid and Mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. A 95-min gradient was preceded by a 15-min washing period (100% A) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min21 to remove residual salt. Following the wash, the mobile phase was programmed to 25% B by 50 min, followed by an increase to 90% B by 65 min and held for 9min before returning to the initial conditions.AfullMSscanwas collected for peptides from400â€?,000 m/z on the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000 followed by eight data-dependentMS/MS scans fromlowest to highest signal intensity on the linear trap quadrupole (LTQ). Centroided MS/MS scans were acquired using an isolation width of 3 m/z, an activation time of 30 ms, an activation q of 0.250 and 35% normalized collision energy.Onemicroscanwith amax ion time of 100 msand 1,000 ms was used for each MS/MS and full MS scan, respectively. MS/MS spectra were collected using a dynamic exclusion of 60 s with a repeat of 1 and repeat duration of 1. All TCGA samples were analysed on the same Thermo LTQ Orbitrap Velos instrument, with sample analysis beginning on 26 July 2012 and concluding on 17 February 2013. Benchmark quality control samples from one basal and one luminal human breast tumour xenograft were analysed in alternating order after every five CRC samples. Specifically, five TCGA samples were run on the instrument, followed by a luminal CompRef sample, and then another five TCGA samples followed by a basal CompRef sample. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) tryptic digest standards were analysed before and after every ten TCGA samples and were used to monitor instrument sensitivity, BSA standard sequence coverage and chromatographic performance to determine acceptance or rejection of the acquired data.	Basic protein identification used the RefSeq human protein sequence database, release version 54, and both database and peptide library search strategies. Two bovine trypsin sequences and one porcine trypsin sequence were appended to these 34,586 sequences. The 14 June 2011 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) human spectral library for ion traps (617,000 spectra, counting paired decoys) was indexed against this sequence database. Thermo RAW files were converted to mzML peaklists by the ScanSifter algorithm or by ProteoWizard msConvert. The ScanSifter files were employed by Pepitome 1.0.42 (ref. 44) for spectral library search and MyriMatch 2.1.87 (ref. 45) for database search, whereas the msConvert files were used by MS-GF+ v9176 (ref. 46). Pepitome and MyriMatch used precursor tolerances of 10 p.p.m., whileMS-GF1used a 20-p.p.m. window; all three algorithms allowed fragments to vary by up to 0.5 m/z, and both database search engines considered semi-tryptic peptides equally with fully tryptic peptides, allowed for isotopic error in precursor ion selection, conducted on-the-fly peptide sequence reversal, and applied static 157 modifications to cysteines and dynamic 116 oxidations to methionines. MS-GF+ considered acetylation for protein amino termini, whereas MyriMatch added pyroglutamine modifications to the N termini of peptides starting with Gln residues. Pepitome considered any modification variants and trypsin specificities that were included in the spectral library.
