Investigation Title	The exploration of Missing Proteins by a combination approach to enrich the low abundance membrane proteins from several cancer cell lines
Experiment Description	Our goal is the identification of more and more the missing proteins from cancer cell lines. This project focuses on the membrance proteins separated by the ultracentrifuge and the low abundant peptides enriched by the Proteominer Kit and the hydrophobic peptides extracted by the organic solvent Acetonitrile.

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-Sample-PXD014058	P-MTAB-Data-PXD014058
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	1.The cell samples ultracentrifuge by 100,000g ,1 hour X 3 times. 2.Proteominer. 3.The organic solvent acetonitrile extracts the hydrophobic peptides after the digestion. 4.The peptides were fractionated by micro-HPLC and analyzed by LUMOS instrument.	Data processing protocol: The MS data was loaded to Proteome Discoverer 2.2 software with the processing workflow parameters as below: full trypsin and semi trypsin mode; maximum cleavage site 2; MS1 tolerance 20 ppm; MS2 tolerance 0.05 Da; database Swiss-Prot human;fixed modification carbamidomethy (C); variable modification oxidation (M) and diamidation (NQ).The PSM result was filtered by Percolator and 1% FDR.
